		<h1>Backstory</h1>
    <p>A long time ago was born James Gosling, after designing his first weapon of mass destruction called Java he then proceeded to change his research field.</p>
    <p>A few years back he started to take interest in micro biology and infectious deceases. After a bit of time, he became known as Dr Mad.</p>
    <p>You have now entered his laboratory but it's password protected, will you be able to find the username and password?</p>
    <p>If you don't, James will be able to create the most monstrous viruses ever known and you will let him finally destroy the world for good.</p>
    <p>(Don't let anyone know but I heard he teamed up with Fabien Potencier, you know the creator of Symfony)</p>
    <p>Good luck! ;)</p>
